[Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) of academic computer science papers and a community of people who love reading them. Originally started in New York City to scratch an itch for [Zeeshan Lakhani](https://twitter.com/zeeshanlakhani), Papers We Love has grown into a series of regular meetups held in cities around the world. As one of the founding members of the [New York Chapter](http://paperswelove.org/chapter/newyork/) I lent a hand in putting together the identity and site for the organization.

The primary purpose of the organization is to read and discuss academic computer science papers. There is a long tradition within academia of publishing papers using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), an early typesetting software package and language developed by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) specifically to render math heavy papers and books. The primary typeface used with LaTeX is [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern).

From a design perspective I wanted to pay homage to the rich history of the subject by modeling the organization's identity and site design in the manner of an academic paper. The identity itself also contains a clever play on computer science and mathematics by incorporating an [identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function), *f(x) = x*, within the logotype itself.

I'd like to give a big shout out to everyone who has volunteered their time and efforts to make Papers We Love a success, and especially to those brave folks who step up to present a paper. Consider stopping by a meetup near you to join in on the vibrant discussions.
