IRAmarket helps folks find better homes for their 401ks and IRAs. Working closely with the founders I designed a comparison tool which helps investors determine which banks or funds would give them the best deals for rolling over their accounts. In addition to information design I developed the overall site designs, putting a friendly face on a traditionally stodgy and convoluted business.
