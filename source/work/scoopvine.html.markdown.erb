Scoopvine provided a platform for the distribution of direct marketing videos combined with an e-commerce solution. Think YouTube for infomercials combined with Amazon. Users could watch infomercials on a product and make a purchase on the same page. Merchants also had the ability to wrap their branding around their entire "channel" creating a unified experience.
