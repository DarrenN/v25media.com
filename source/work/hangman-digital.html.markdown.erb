[Hangman Digital](http://hangmandigital.com) needed a portfolio site that would allow them to upload and manage video files. In addition to display within the public portfolio, they needed to have private areas available where specific videos could be assembled into a playlist for view.

After handling the information architecture and design phase I put together a custom CMS which would allow admins to upload and categorize video for public consumption, as well as create private 'clipbins' for sharing with clients.  

<%= entry_asset({:url => '/img/hangmandigital_home.png', :alt => 'Homepage', :title => 'Home | Hangman Digital'}, '/img/hangmandigital_home.png') %>

<%= entry_asset({:url => '/img/hangmandigital_category.png', :alt => 'Category', :title => 'Category | Hangman Digital'}, '/img/hangmandigital_category.png') %>

<%= entry_asset({:url => '/img/hangmandigital_clipbin.png', :alt => 'Clipbin', :title => 'Clipbin | Hangman Digital'}, '/img/hangmandigital_clipbin.png') %>
