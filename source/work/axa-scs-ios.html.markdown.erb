AXA Equitable wanted to create an iPad application for its mobile salesforce. The app's intent was to illustrate different retirement investments to potential clients, and had a rather complex set of requirements and compliance regulations to follow. Ultimately I was able to put together the wireframes and UI designs for a fully functional and sharp looking app.
