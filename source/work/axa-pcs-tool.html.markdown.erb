AXA Equitable needed help putting together a document generation tool that would allow their salesforce to build customized documents for current and potential clients. I gladly put together a comprehensive wireframe and set of UI designs for said web application.

<%= entry_asset({:url => '/img/axa_pcs_preview.png', :alt => 'Preview', :title => 'Preview | AXA Equitable'}, '/img/axa_pcs_preview.png') %>

<%= entry_asset({:url => '/img/axa_pcs_mydocuments.png', :alt => 'Docs', :title => 'My Documents | AXA Equitable'}, '/img/axa_pcs_mydocuments.png') %>
