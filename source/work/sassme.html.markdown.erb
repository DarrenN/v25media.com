[SassMe](http://sassme.arc90.com/) is a tool for designers/developers to help visualize [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) color functions. Inputting an initial color a designer can adjust it with the sliders and then grab the color function for use in their stylesheets. This was the first lab project I worked on for [Arc90](http://lab.arc90.com/2012/09/18/sassme/).

The original idea and prototype for SassMe was put forward by [Jim Nielsen](http://www.jim-nielsen.com/) and the UI was fully blown out by [Matt Quintanilla](http://redkeg.com/) and [Robert Petro](http://arc90.com/team/robert-petro/) - all UI designers at Arc90. I took on porting over the SASS color transformations to CoffeeScript and implementing all of the client side JavaScript to drive the application.
